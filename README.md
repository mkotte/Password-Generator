#Password-Generator

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Completed Work

While creating this password generator I:

* Gave the user options on the length and characters to be included in their new password

* Used Bootstrap to create a modal with two different input types

* Created a generatePassword function evaluating the modal's form values

* Used conditional truthy logic to insure that the user selected at least one character type for their new password

* Styled the page to look professional


## Mock-Up
